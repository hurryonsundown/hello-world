# hello-world
This is my getting-to-know-github repository.
I am new to GitHub, but not to Git.
I am a bored C# developer returning to programming for Linux and the Web.
I have had experience (but not for a while) in creating bespoke services for Linux. 
I developed a CCTV security system for Linux. The data was entered through a Web portal running on LAMP.
I'm not actually that keen on PHP.
I'm currently learning Python from scratch.
My favourite engineering principle is Keep It Simple, Stupid.
